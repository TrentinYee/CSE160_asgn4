Ripped the maurice image right off the ULTRAKILL wiki
This project is inspired by the ULTRAKILL CyberGrind

Looked at https://people.ucsc.edu/~jwdicker/Asgn3/BlockyWorld.html
for figuring out vertical rotation

Useded some ChatGPT prompts and the threejs spotlight description to figure out that the spotlight implementation is very similair to the specular lighting.

used code snippets from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API#browser_compatibility
in order to get mouse rotation working

Also used code from this article as well https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Control_mechanisms/Desktop_with_mouse_and_keyboard
for smoother movement

This is all possible in general due to the "WebGL Programming Guide" by Matsuda & Lee
