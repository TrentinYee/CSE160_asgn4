Ripped the maurice image right off the ULTRAKILL wiki
This project is inspired by the ULTRAKILL CyberGrind

Looked at https://people.ucsc.edu/~jwdicker/Asgn3/BlockyWorld.html
for figuring out vertical rotation

used code snippets from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API#browser_compatibility
in order to get mouse rotation working

Also used code from this article as well https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Control_mechanisms/Desktop_with_mouse_and_keyboard
for smoother movement
